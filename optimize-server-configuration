1. run atleast 3 process per server
   Puma
    $ puma -w 3 # Command-line option
    workers 3 # in your config/puma.rb

    # Unicorn
    worker_processes 3 # config/unicorn.rb

    # Passenger (nginx/Standalone)
    # Passenger can automatically scale workers up and down - I don't find this
    # super useful. Instead, just run a constant number by setting the max and min:
    passenger_max_pool_size 3;
    passenger_min_instances 3;

    # or using env variables
    workers Integer(ENV["WEB_CONCURRENCY"] || 3)

2. set thred count to 5
    # unicorn has no threads

    # Puma. Again, I don't really use the "automatic" spin-up/spin-down features, so
    # I set the max and min to the same number.
    $ puma -t 5:5 # Command-line option
    threads 5, 5 # in your config/puma.rb

    # Passenger (nginx/Standalone)
    passenger_concurrency_model thread;
    passenger_thread_count 5;

3. Application Container
    # one application standard: 4vCPU/ 4gb of RAM with 6 ruby process
    # or *vCPUs and 2GB of RAM
